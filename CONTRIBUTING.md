# Contributing to CmdShift

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to **CmdShift** - the AI-first IDE!

There are many ways to contribute beyond writing code. This document provides an overview of how you can get involved in building the future of AI-powered development.

## Asking Questions

Have a question about CmdShift or AI-powered development? Instead of opening an issue, please ask on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/pranit2510/cmdshiftv3/discussions) using relevant tags.

Our active community of AI-focused developers will be eager to assist you. Well-written questions serve as valuable resources for others exploring AI-first development workflows.

## Providing Feedback

Your feedback on AI features and development workflows is invaluable! The CmdShift team is available through multiple channels:

* [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/pranit2510/cmdshiftv3/discussions) - General discussions and feature ideas
* [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/pranit2510/cmdshiftv3/issues) - Bug reports and formal feature requests
* [Community Discord](#) - Real-time chat with other CmdShift developers

## Reporting Issues

Found a bug in CmdShift or have an idea for an AI feature? We want to hear about it! Here's how to report effectively:

### Identify Where to Report

CmdShift development is focused in this main repository. For issues related to:

* **Core AI features** - Report here
* **Editor functionality** - Report here
* **Extension compatibility** - Check if it's an extension-specific issue first
* **Performance issues** - Include detailed performance data

### Look for Existing Issues

Before creating a new issue, search our [open issues](https://github.com/pranit2510/cmdshiftv3/issues) to see if it's already been reported.

Check our [most popular feature requests](https://github.com/pranit2510/cmdshiftv3/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) - especially those related to AI functionality.

If you find an existing issue, add relevant comments and reactions:
* üëç - upvote
* üëé - downvote
* üéØ - "I need this for my AI workflow"
* üöÄ - "This would be a game-changer"

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File one issue per problem or feature request. For AI-related issues, include:

**For AI Feature Bugs:**
* Version of CmdShift
* AI feature being used (chat, completion, analysis, etc.)
* Your operating system
* Sample code or context that triggered the issue
* Expected vs actual AI behavior
* Screenshots or recordings of the AI interaction

**For AI Feature Requests:**
* Clear description of the AI capability you want
* Use case and workflow context
* How it would improve your development process
* Examples from other AI tools if relevant

**Always Include:**
* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...)
* CmdShift version and OS
* Relevant code snippets
* Console errors (Help > Toggle Developer Tools)

Use CmdShift's built-in **"Report Issue"** tool from the Help menu - it automatically includes system info and extension details.

### Creating Pull Requests

### Final Checklist

Before submitting:

* [ ] Search existing issues to avoid duplicates

## AI Development Guidelines

When working on AI features:

* **Keep it simple** - Focus on developer productivity
* **Context-aware** - Leverage the full codebase context
* **Fast and responsive** - AI should enhance, not slow down workflow
* **Privacy-conscious** - Respect user code and data privacy
* **Extensible** - Build features that other developers can extend

## Automated Issue Management

We use GitHub Actions to manage our workflow:

* Auto-close issues marked `needs-info` after 7 days without response
