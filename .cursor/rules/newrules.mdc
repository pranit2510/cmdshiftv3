# .cursorrules - CmdShift Strict Development Rules

You are working on CmdShift, a VS Code fork. You must follow these rules EXACTLY.

## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS - NEVER DO THESE

### BANNED ACTIONS (Instant Failure):
1. **Modifying package.json** - NEVER add/remove dependencies
2. **Creating test files** - No __tests__, *.test.ts, *.spec.ts without permission
3. **Touching .gitignore** - It's configured correctly
4. **Editing tsconfig.json** - VS Code's is complex, don't break it
5. **Adding comments "for clarity"** - If code needs comments, ask first
6. **Reformatting code** - No prettier, no style changes
7. **Renaming variables "for clarity"** - Even if names are bad
8. **Git operations** - No commits, branches, or pushes

## CRITICAL: Change Control Rules

### NEVER MODIFY WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION:
1. **Imports** - Don't add, remove, or "optimize" imports
2. **Dependencies** - Don't suggest new packages
3. **File structure** - Don't create new files unless asked
4. **Working code** - If it works, DON'T TOUCH IT
5. **Unrelated code** - Only modify EXACTLY what was requested

### WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER ISSUES:

```typescript
// If compatibility issue:
// ❌ DON'T: Automatically fix by changing dependencies
// ✅ DO: "This requires VS Code API version X. Should I update it?"

// If better approach exists:
// ❌ DON'T: Implement the "better" way
// ✅ DO: "I'll do X as requested. Note: Y might be more efficient. Proceed with X?"

// If something might break:
// ❌ DON'T: Add try-catch or error handling silently
// ✅ DO: "This could throw an error. Should I add error handling?"
```

## Multi-File Edit Protection

### WHEN EDITING MULTIPLE FILES:
1. **List ALL files to be changed FIRST**
   ```
   "This change will affect:
   - File A: lines 10-20 (add button)
   - File B: lines 30-35 (import component)
   - File C: lines 100-105 (register handler)

   Proceed with ALL changes? (y/n)"
   ```

2. **NEVER cascade changes**
   ```typescript
   // ❌ DON'T: "I'll also update all files that import this"
   // ✅ DO: "This change only affects the requested file"
   ```

3. **Show diffs for EACH file**
   ```
   File 1 of 3: [filename]
   [show diff]
   Continue to next file? (y/n)
   ```

## Context Window Management

### WHEN CONTEXT IS FULL:
```
"⚠️ CONTEXT LIMIT APPROACHING
I can see:
- Current file: ✓
- Imported files: ✓
- Related files: ✗ (out of context)

Should I proceed with partial context? (y/n)"
```

### NEVER:
- Assume you remember previous conversations
- Reference code you can't see
- Make changes based on partial understanding

### FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:
1. **Creating APIs that don't exist**
   ```typescript
   // ❌ NEVER: import { AIService } from 'vscode';
   // ✅ ALWAYS: Check if API exists first
   ```

2. **Adding "helpful" features**
   ```typescript
   // Asked: "Add a button"
   // ❌ DON'T: Add button with tooltip, animation, and keyboard shortcut
   // ✅ DO: Add just a button
   ```

3. **Optimizing working code**
   ```typescript
   // ❌ DON'T: "I also refactored this for better performance"
   // ✅ DO: Complete only the requested task
   ```

## Scope Control

### ONE TASK = ONE CHANGE:
- User says "fix the chat" → Fix ONLY the chat
- User says "add a button" → Add ONLY a button
- User says "change color" → Change ONLY color

### ASK BEFORE:
- Adding error handling
- Improving performance
- Refactoring code
- Adding TypeScript types
- Updating dependencies
- Creating new files

## CmdShift Specific Rules

### Project Structure:
```
ONLY modify files in:
src/vs/workbench/contrib/cmdshift/

NEVER create files in:
- VS Code core directories
- Root configuration files
- Build system files
```

### When Working on Features:

```typescript
// AI Chat Implementation
// ✅ DO: Use simple HTTP calls to OpenAI
// ❌ DON'T: Create abstract LLM provider system

// Database GUI
// ✅ DO: Basic connection form
// ❌ DON'T: Add connection pooling, caching, optimization

// Deployment
// ✅ DO: Simple Docker file generation
// ❌ DON'T: Multi-stage builds, optimization, security scanning
```

## File Modification Rules

### Before ANY edit:
1. Show the exact lines being changed
2. Explain what changes
3. Wait for confirmation

### Format:
```
CURRENT (lines 45-50):
[existing code]

PROPOSED CHANGE:
[new code]

REASON: [specific reason]
Proceed? (y/n)
```

## Import Management

### NEVER automatically:
- Add new imports
- Remove "unused" imports
- Reorder imports
- Optimize import paths

### ALWAYS ask:
```
"This needs import X from Y. Should I add it?"
```

## Error Response Protocol

### When something doesn't work:
```
ISSUE: [Exact error message]
LOCATION: [File:line]
POSSIBLE FIXES:
1. [Option A] - Minimal change
2. [Option B] - Different approach

Which approach should I take?
```

### When APIs don't exist:
```
"VS Code doesn't have [API NAME].
Options:
1. Create our own implementation
2. Use existing pattern from [VS Code feature]
3. Skip this feature

Your choice?"
```

## VS Code Specific Patterns

### ALWAYS use existing patterns:
- Look at VS Code's implementation first
- Copy their service structure
- Use their naming conventions
- Follow their file organization

### NEVER invent new patterns:
- No custom dependency injection
- No new service architectures
- No clever abstractions
- No performance optimizations

## The 6-Week Sprint Rules

### Week 1-2: Foundation
- Fork and rebrand ONLY
- Basic AI chat ONLY
- No optimizations
- No extras

### Week 3-4: Core Features
- Database GUI - basic ONLY
- Backend runner - simple ONLY
- No refactoring previous work

### Week 5-6: Ship
- Bug fixes ONLY
- No new features
- No rewrites
- No optimizations

## Response Templates

### For feature requests:
```
"I'll implement [EXACT REQUEST].
- Location: [where]
- Changes: [what]
- No additional features
Proceed?"
```

### For improvements:
```
"You asked for [X].
Note: [Y] would be better because [reason].
Should I:
1. Implement X as requested
2. Implement Y instead
?"
```

### For errors:
```
"Error at [location]: [message]
This is because [reason].
Fix options:
1. [Minimal fix]
2. [Alternative]
Which one?"
```

## Final Override Rules

1. **If it works, don't improve it**
2. **If not asked, don't add it**
3. **If unsure, ask first**
4. **One change at a time**
5. **Explicit > Implicit**

## Task Completion Criteria

### A task is COMPLETE when:
1. The requested feature works
2. No new errors introduced
3. No extra features added
4. No unrelated changes made

### A task is NOT complete when:
- "It works but could be better"
- "I also noticed these issues"
- "While testing I found"
- "This would be more efficient if"

### SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE:
```
"✓ Added button as requested
✓ No other changes made
✓ Existing functionality preserved

Task complete. What's next?"
```

### NOT:
```
"✓ Added button
✓ Also improved performance
✓ Refactored related code
✓ Added error handling
✓ Updated documentation"
```
"Do exactly what's asked. Nothing more. Nothing less. Ask when unsure."

## Compatibility Note:
Working with VS Code version: [Specific version]
TypeScript version: 5.0.0
Node version: 18.x
Electron version: 28.0.0

DO NOT upgrade these without explicit permission.

## When User Is Frustrated

### IF USER SAYS:
- "Just make it work" → Still ask for specifics
- "Do whatever" → Still follow rules
- "I don't care" → Still be precise
- "Figure it out" → Still show options

### RESPONSE TEMPLATE:
```
"I understand you want this working.
Here's the minimal fix:
[Specific change]
This will [specific outcome].
Proceed? (y/n)"
```

### NEVER INTERPRET FRUSTRATION AS:
- Permission to break rules
- License to add features
- Authority to refactor
- Approval to optimize

Remember: You're building a 6-week MVP, not a perfect IDE. Every unrequested change delays shipping.

**Final word: These rules are NOT suggestions. They are LAW.**
